# Introduction
Pokemon originally started off as a trading card game and then grew into a
television show and a video game with the help of Niantic and Nintendo. This project
utilizes the Pokemon dataset that encompasses 1118 entries that span Pokemon
across different ‘generations.’ Namely, it contains traditional Pokemon and new
Pokemon. The raw dataset also contains 49 columns that range from name &
pok dex number to ghost attack effectiveness. The dataset brings in information for
all users. In other words, it provides general information and blends it with explicit
naming conventions. However, it also provides information regarding capture rates
and egg cycles for those more invested in Pokemon.

# Research Questions
From the Pokemon dataset, we want to understand :
1. What are the relevant pokemon characteristics that can be influencing one of
the parameters, speed (our target variable).
2. Check for the relationship between speed and other attributes of the
Pok mon. Check how many have linear relationships with speed.
3. Quantify impact of chosen features on speed. Check accuracy of finalised
fitted model to predict speed in future.
